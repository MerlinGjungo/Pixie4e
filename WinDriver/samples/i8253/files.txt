i8253

This file contains:
1. An overview of the i8253 sample.
2. The contents of the i8253/ directory.
3. Instructions for compiling the i8253 sample.


1. Overview
   =========
   The Intel 8253/8254 programmable timer chip is a standard component on any
   IBM PC motherboard. The chip provides 3 independent timers (referred to as
   "channels") and a single control register.

   The i8253 sample sets the channel to 0 for maximum rate and then
   continuously reads the timer values.


2. Files
   ======
   - i8253.c
         The main file, which implements the sample.

   - files.txt
         Describes the sample files.


   For Windows:
   ------------
   - x86/ directory - Windows x86 32-bit files:

     - msdev_2010/ sub-directory:
      - i8253.vcxproj
            MSDEV 2010 (.NET) project file
      - i8253.sln
            MSDEV 2010 (.NET) solution file

   - amd64/ directory - Windows x64 64-bit files:

     - msdev_2010/ sub-directory:
       - i8253.vcxproj
             MSDEV 2010 (.NET) project file
       - i8253.sln
             MSDEV 2010 (.NET) solution file

   - WIN32/ sub-directory:
     - i8253.exe
           The compiled sample program for Windows


   For Linux:
   ----------
   - LINUX/ sub-directory:
     - makefile
           GNU make makefile for building the project
     - i8253
           The compiled sample program for Linux


3. Compiling the sample:
   =====================
   To compile and build the sample application you need an appropriate C/C++
   compiler for your development platform.

   - On Windows: If you are using one of the supported MSDEV or Borland C++
     Builder IDEs (see above): open the sample project/workspace/solution
     file from the relevant compiler sub-directory and simply build the project.

   - On Linux: If you are using GNU make, simply build the sample
     using the makefile from the LINUX/.

   - If you are using a different C/C++ compiler or make utility:
     - Create a new console mode project/makefile for your compiler.
     - The project/makefile will refer to a single source file:
       WinDriver/samples/i8253/i8253.c
