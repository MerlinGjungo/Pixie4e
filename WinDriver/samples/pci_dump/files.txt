PCI_DUMP

This file contains:
1. An overview of the pci_dump sample.
2. The contents of the pci_dump/ directory.
3. Instructions for compiling the pci_dump sample.
4. Guidelines for converting pci_dump from a console-mode (CUI)
   application to a graphical (GUI) application.


1. Overview
   =========
   The pci_dump sample provides a dump of all the PCI configuration
   registers of the installed PCI cards.


2. Files
   ======
   This section describes the sub-directories and files provided under the
   pci_dump/ directory.

   The source code was created by Jungo Connectivity using WinDriver's API.

   - pci_dump.c
         The main file, which implements the sample.

   - files.txt
        Describes the sample files.


   For Windows:
   ------------
   - x86/ directory - Windows x86 32-bit files:

     - msdev_2010/ sub-directory:
      - pci_dump.vcxproj
            MSDEV 2010 (.NET) project file
      - pci_dump.sln
            MSDEV 2010 (.NET) solution file

   - amd64/ directory - Windows x64 64-bit files:

     - msdev_2010/ sub-directory:
       - pci_dump.vcxproj
             MSDEV 2010 (.NET) project file
       - pci_dump.sln
             MSDEV 2010 (.NET) solution file

   - WIN32/ sub-directory:
     - pci_dump.exe
           The compiled sample program for Windows


   For Linux:
   ----------
   - LINUX/ sub-directory:
     - makefile
           GNU make makefile for building the project
     - pci_dump
           The compiled sample program for Linux


3. Compiling the sample:
   =====================
   To compile and build the sample application you need an appropriate C/C++
   compiler for your development platform.

   - On Windows: If you are using one of the supported MSDEV or Borland C++
     Builder IDEs (see above): open the sample project/workspace/solution
     file from the relevant compiler sub-directory and simply build the project.

   - On Linux: If you are using GNU make, simply build the sample
     using the makefile from the LINUX/ sub-directory.

   - If you are using a different C/C++ compiler or make utility:
     - Create a new console mode project/makefile for your compiler.
     - Add the following files to the project/makefile:
       WinDriver/samples/pci_dump/pci_dump.c
       WinDriver/samples/shared/wdc_diag_lib.c
       WinDriver/samples/shared/diag_lib.c
     - Link your project with the WinDriver/lib/wdapi<version>.lib (Windows)
       or WinDriver/lib/libwdapi<version>.so (Linux) OR
       add the following files (which are exported in the wdapi<version> DLL /
       shared object) to your project/makefile:
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/utils.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/windrvr_int_thread.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/windrvr_events.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/status_strings.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_general.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_cfg.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_mem_io.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_ints.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_events.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_err.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_dma.c
     - Build your project.


4. Converting to a GUI application:
   ================================
   This sample was written as a console mode application (rather than a GUI
   application) that uses standard input and standard output.
   This was done in order to simplify the source code. You can change the
   sample into a GUI application by replacing all calls to <stdio.h> functions
   such as printf(), sprintf(), scanf(), etc. with relevant GUI functions and
   replacing the main() function in pci_dump.c with a GUI equivalent.
