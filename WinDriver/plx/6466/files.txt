  - p6466_diag.c
        A sample diagnostics program for accessing the PLX6466 board using
        WinDriver's plx/lib, plx/plx_diag_lib and plx/6466/lib_6466 libraries,
        and the WDC API.
        The sample demonstrates how you can:
        - Scan the PCI bus and acquire resources information for the board
        - Read/write the board's configuration space
        - Access the board's serial EEPROM
    
  - files.txt
        Describes the sample files.

  For Windows 2k/XP/Server 2003:
  ------------------------------------
  - p6466.inf
         A sample WinDriver INF file for registering the PLX6466 board with
         WinDriver's kernel-mode driver (windrvr1281.sys).
         NOTE: To use this file, change the vendor and device IDs in the file
               to comply with those of your specific device.


  For Linux:
  ----------
  - LINUX/ sub-directory:
    - makefile
          GNU make makefile for building the sample
    - p6466_diag
          The compiled sample program for Linux
  
  
Compiling the sample:
=====================
To compile and build the sample application you need an appropriate C/C++
compiler for your development platform.

  - On Windows: If you are using one of the supported MSDEV or Borland C++
    Builder IDEs (see above): open the sample project/workspace/solution
    file from the relevant compiler sub-directory and simply build the project.
    
  - On Linux: If you are using GNU make, simply build the sample
    using the makefile from the LINUX/ sub-directory.
    
  - If you are using a different C/C++ compiler or make utility:
    - Create a new console mode project/makefile for your compiler.
    - Add the following files to the project/makefile:
      WinDriver/plx/p6466_diag/p6466_diag.c
      WinDriver/plx/6466/lib_6466/plx_lib_6466.c
      WinDriver/plx/diag_lib/plx_diag_lib.c
      WinDriver/plx/lib/plx_lib.c
      WinDriver/samples/shared/wdc_diag_lib.c
      WinDriver/samples/shared/diag_lib.c
    - Link your project with the WinDriver/lib/wdapi<version>.lib (Windows)
      or WinDriver/lib/libwdapi<version>.so (Linux) OR
      add the following files (which are exported in the wdapi<version> DLL /
      shared object) to your project/makefile:
      WinDriver/src/wdapi/utils.c
      WinDriver/src/wdapi/windrvr_int_thread.c
      WinDriver/src/wdapi/windrvr_events.c
      WinDriver/src/wdapi/status_strings.c
      WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_general.c
      WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_cfg.c
      WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_mem_io.c
      WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_ints.c
      WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_events.c
      WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_err.c
      WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_dma.c
    - Build your project.


Converting to a GUI application:
================================
  This sample was written as a console mode application (rather than a GUI 
  application) that uses standard input and standard output.
  This was done in order to simplify the source code. You can change the sample
  into a GUI application by replacing all calls to <stdio.h> functions such 
  as printf(), sprintf(), scanf(), etc. with relevant GUI functions and
  replacing the main() function in p6466_diag.c with a GUI equivalent.
